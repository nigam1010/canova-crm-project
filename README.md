## ✅ ONE UNIFIED APPLICATION
Note to Evaluator:
"This project uses a Unified Micro-Frontend architecture. Please log in with the provided Admin credentials to see the Admin Interface, or Employee credentials to see the User Interface."
This is a single React application that shows different interfaces based on user role:
- **Admin** → Desktop dashboard (full screen)
- Email: admin@canovacrm.com
- Password: admin@canovacrm.com
- **Employee** → Mobile-optimized interface (max 430px width)
- Email: Use any created employee email (In admin interface choose any user email Id and logout using logout button in the bottom of sidebar)
- Password: same as email (default)
- → Shows mobile interface

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. User enters email & password
2. System checks role from backend
3. **If Admin** → Redirects to `/dashboard` (desktop layout)
4. **If Employee** → Redirects to `/employee` (mobile layout)

### Employee Interface (Mobile-First)
- Max width: 430px, centered
- Blue header with user greeting
- Bottom navigation (Home, Leads, Schedule, Profile)
- All pages match reference images exactly
